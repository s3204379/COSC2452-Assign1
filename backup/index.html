    Fun fact about me: I love gaming, but in particular vintage games such as Final Fantasy 8. What drew me to this game was not only the story telling element, but also the programming, make your own adventure, music, sound effects and graphics. I'm amazed by that the various codes and scenarios that the game developers must have thought up and designed to program each choice and decision to be unique to the player.
