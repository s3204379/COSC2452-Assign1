		<strong>Description of the Position and What makes this appealing to me</strong>
		<p>The client of Perigon Group is looking for a Data Analyst that can work with government, industry, consumer and stakeholder groups to understand, process and transform data into meaningful insights and information through dashboards that are interactive and clear to understand. 
		<br>This appeals to me as I have a keen interest in analysing data and working with people to follow processes and standards to produce high quality reports and information. I believe it will give me good job satisfaction to work for a not-for-profit organisation that has a clear vision to develop standards with no strings attached to any company/government body.</p>
		<br>
		<strong>Description of Skills, Qualifications and Experience for the Position</strong>
		<ul>
			<p><li>Soft skills – Position requires strong communication to ensure a good working relationship with colleagues, vendors, clients and other groups.</li></p>
			<p><li>Technical Skills in Software such as Python, Power BI, Microsoft Azure, SQL and Knime/Alteryx.</li></p>
			<p><li>Analytical and Problem Solving Skills – Candidate will deal with large and often complex amounts of data so as to identify and extract relevant data and business requirements needed to facilitate in reports and dashboards.</li></p>
			<p><li>Process Driven experience and compliance to standards – In most companies/organisations, there are processes and standards in which each employee follows to ensure the information produced are clear and consistent to their vision, layout and aesthetic.</li></p>
			<li>Willingness to Learn skill - The job ad had a last requirement on 'investigating, recommending and integrating/deploying third party solutions', which I interpret to mean that the organisation would like the candidate to be open minded and have strong ability to work with different tools/people that may change on regular basis.</li>

				<strong>Description of Skills, Qualifications and Experience I currently have</strong> 
				<ul>
					<p><li>Soft Skills - I have strong communication skills and have good working relationships with my current colleagues, staff and 3rd party vendors.</li></p>
					<p><li>Technical Skill - I have some experience in programming in SQL. I have used Power BI as an end user when a dashboard has already been pre-created.</li></p>
					<p><li>Process Driven and compliance to standards - My current workplace has regular audits and we therefore have procedures and policies in place so we comply and pass in areas like data security and governance.</li></p>
					<p><li>Willingness to Learn skill - Being in the IT industry, things are always evolving and changing such as standards, hardware, software, code and practises and by default, most, including myself, have that adaptiveness skill to learn, or otherwise be left behind.</li></p>

			<strong>A plan on how I plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience</strong> 
				<ul>
					<p><li>Technical Skill - I'm currently enrolled in <a href="https://online.rmit.edu.au/course/sc-intro-programming-dev101u" target="_blank">COSC2452</a>, which is an introduction to Python. After I've completed this and <a href="https://online.rmit.edu.au/course/sc-intro-programming-dev101u" target="_blank">COSC2452</a>, I may look into some summer courses like <a href="https://online.rmit.edu.au/courses/futureskills/bundle/business-analytics" target="_blank">Business Analytics</a>. I will also be regularly looking to obtain industry recognised certificates like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals/" target="_blank">Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals</a>.</li></p>
					<p><li>Analytical and Problem Solving Skills - I believe programming gives us a fundamental structure in problem solving, breaking things into small bit size pieces to make a larger program. Thru university work and group collaboration, I hope to build upon these skills and also obtain new methodologies and techniques to solve problems</li></p>
					<p><li> Experience - Once I have gained the technical skills, I will look to get some experience thru either internships I find on job websites or my current workplace. I would also be speaking to and get advice from data analysts at my current workplace on their successes and failures so that I may make informed decisions on tools they use to be successful and efficient.</li></p>
