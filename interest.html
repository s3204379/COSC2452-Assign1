        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
		<hr>
        <p>
			<strong>What is your Interest in IT? When did your Interest in IT start?</strong>
			<p>I'm interested in gaming, IoT, communications and data analysis. I've had an interested in IT since I was a child. The earliest memory would have to be thru gaming in 1990. I received a Gameboy for Christmas. I remember being excited about how 'compact' the game cartridges were and enthralled by the idea of being able to change and load a variety of games. The games I was given were Tetris and Super Mario Land, which would explain my weird obsession with 'ordering' and 'sorting' (see <a href="index.html">personal information</a>). I like the logic in coding and have included a short story I made in C# in next segment of this <a href="#myShortFilm">page.</a></p>
			<br>
			<strong>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</strong>
			<p>I started being fascinated with computers in high school in 1998. My uncle had come to live with us from Singapore and he was studying computer science at a university nearby that provided free internet service. Back then, it was a 56kbps modem and I remembered how amazed I was that what was traditionally a telephone line that we used to speak with friends and family, had transformed to be a piece of technology that you can use to ask questions and get answers, i.e. the Internet.</p>

		<strong>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong>
		<p>I chose RMIT because I believe the university courses are well structured, thoughtout, relatively fresh and modern to what the IT industry standards and employers are looking for. I'm especially been impressed so far by the syllabus and teaching staff on not reading from an outdated text books. I dreaded the traditional teaching method of read and remember. My other reason was the adaptiveness and flexibility the university had to providing an online learning platform for students like me who can't afford to take time off to complete a degree in person.</p>
		<br>
		<strong>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong>
		<p>I hope to learn best practices on approaching IT projects in a more structured, analytical, ethical and methodical way. Thru technical units like programming, I aspire to learn skills that would assist with simplifying, automating and producing more valuable information and apps. </p>
